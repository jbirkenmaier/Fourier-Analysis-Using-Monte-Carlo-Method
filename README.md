# Fourier-Analysis

A very basic Machine-Learning Algorithm, involving the Monte-Carlo-Method to find the Fourier-Series Approximation of a given Signal

The Following Image shows the result of the approximation of a sine wave (red). The Longer the runtime of the algorithm, the better the approximation.
